## List of game elements

- bumper
  While the most recognized type is a pop bumper, it is broadly any component that stands vertical to the playfield for the ball to bounce (or bump) against.[31] Originally bumpers were upright cylinders that provided an obstacle and ricochet point for the ball but did not score any points.[32] Those "passive" or "dead" bumpers, advanced around the 1960s to detect a hit and register points and later to include a ring and solenoid that respond to a ball hit by actively shooting it off in another direction.[33] These more widely known "active" bumpers have also been called "jet bumpers" by Williams,[34] "thumper bumpers" by Bally Technologies,[35] and "turbo bumpers" by Data East/Sega.[36] Additional notable bumper types include slingshots,[37] mushroom bumpers (passive and registers points),[38] tower bumpers (passive and registers points),[39] and disappearing bumpers.[33]

- drain:
  The common term used to refer to the area beneath the flippers. If the ball rolls into the drain area via an outlane or between the flippers, it will be lost. Also refers to the act of losing a ball in this manner.

- extra ball:
  An additional bonus ball that can be earned by achieving a specific task.

- playfield:
  The main flat surface of the game, on which targets, ramps, orbits, flippers and bumpers are arranged. "Playfield" refers both to the surface itself and to the overall play area (to distinguish it from other parts of the machine such as the backbox). The ball rolls along this surface. Many games refer to the "lower" playfield (nearest the player) and the "upper" playfield (nearest the backbox). In some cases, this distinction is more literal, as in the separate, vertically-arranged playfield levels in Black Knight 2000.
- plunger: A player-controlled, spring-loaded rod that allows the player to send the ball into the game. The plunger is usually located at the bottom right corner of the pinball machine.

- slingshot: The triangular objects on either side of the flippers that propel the ball toward the opposite side.
- pop bumper: Rround, mushroom-shaped targets set into the playfield of most pinball machines. They register a hit when the ball collides with them and forcefully kick the ball away.
- kickout hole:
  A depression in the pinball table that the ball can fall into. This is usually just large enough for the ball to fit into it. After gaining some points, and/or adjusting the game state, the ball is kicked back into play in a predictable direction and speed.
